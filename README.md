# tipjar
Tip bands since you don't pay for music any more.

## Overview
This is a side project I'm working on designed to track a user's last.fm listening habits and facilitate tipping top artists on a month-to-month basis. I began it May 28 2015 and have been working on it in my spare time.

## Roadmap
* Implement last.fm OAuth [in process]
* Display a user's top artists for a given timeframe
* Implement play money to simulate donations
* Figure out how to actually allow secure donations.


## Notes
Like I said, I'm working on this in my free time after graduating from Dev Bootcamp. It may fall by the wayside as my other projects come and go.
